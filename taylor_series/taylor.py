""" Taylor series expansion of sine function

This script allows the user to expand the taylor series of sine function

This script requires the following packages be installed within the Python
environment you are running this script in:
    * math - To perform mathematical operations such as finding the factorial
    * decimal - To get more precise decimal points

This file contains the following function:

    * main - the main function of the script
